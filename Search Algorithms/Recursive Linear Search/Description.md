# Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array

Given an unsorted array and an element x, search x in given array. Write recursive C code for this. If element is not present, return -1.

## Approach : 
The idea is to compare x with first element in arr[]. If element is found at first position, return it. Else recur for remaining array and x.
